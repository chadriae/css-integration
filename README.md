# css-integration

In this exercise we were asked to pixel-perfect copy the interfaces, with only given the screenshots. I used the Tailwind-framework for the first 2 exercises.

Thoughts: using custom css and background img would have made the pixel-perfect copy of inteface-2 much easier.

- [Interface 1](interface-1)
- [Interface 2](interface-2)
