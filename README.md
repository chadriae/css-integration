## Create pixel-perfect copies using CSS, HTML and Responsive Design

In this exercise (on 02/11/2020) we were asked to pixel-perfect copy the interfaces, with only given screenshots. The screenshots can be found in each folder of the interfaces.
Here you can find the [page](https://github.com/becodeorg/gnt-verou-1-26/tree/master/1.The-Field/4.HTML-CSS/5.End-of-Field/1.Trial-Run) of the exercise.

### Interface 1

This interface is made using HTML and the Tailwind-framework for CSS. No custom CSS is used. The interface is also responsive, as they stack when viewed on a mobile device.

- [Interface 1](interface-1)

### Interface 2

The hardest part of this exercise was getting the right amount of padding and margins. The graph seen here is just a screenshot of the given image.
Made with HTML and Tailwind-framework, added with some custom CSS. Would have been easier just working with custom CSS and using the background image method.

### Interface 3

Again, try to pixel-perfect copy the image. This time I used HTML and Tailwind-CSS with just a small amount of custom CSS, specifically padding, height and width as these values are limited with the framework.

### Extra: complex 10

For the recap on 16/11/2020, I remade an exercise from the [end-of-field-challenge](https://chadriae.github.io/end-of-field-challenge/) that I haven't done before. For this exercise I used plain, **vanilla CSS** without any frameworks.
